# It's time to rak! (Part 3)

This blog post will discuss the types of patterns you can specify with [`rak`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak).  To start right off the bat: the `--type` argument indicates how a given pattern (specified as a string on the command line) should be interpreted.  However, there are a number of shortcuts that you can use to make your life easier.  These will be discussed at the end.

## --type=words

## --type=starts-with

## --type=ends-with

## --type=equal

## --type=contains

## --type=regex

## Ignoring case and accents

## --type=code

## --type=auto

## Shortcuts

These shortcuts are only available if `--type=auto` is explicitely specified, or **no** `--type` argument has been specified.

### Â§string

match if "string" occurs as a **word** in a line

### ^string

match if "string" occurs at the **start** of a line

### string$

match if "string" occurs at the **end** of a line

### ^string$

match if "string" is equal to a line

### string

match if "string" occurs anywhere in a line

### / regex /

match if regex matches a line

### { code }

match if code called with line returns True

### \*code
match if whatever-curried code called with line returns True

Basically, you can recognize three types of patterns that you can specify: literal string, regex or code.

## Regex

Before we go on with how you can use regexes in `rak`, a small detour.

> Everybody knows regular expressions, right?  Well, I guess that's true to some extent.  But regular expressions haven't been regular for a long time already.  That's why it was decided to just call them ["regexes"](https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes) in the Raku Programming Language.

> Regexes in Raku look like your average regular expression: some recipe to tell a state machine to look for matches.  The biggest difference with other regular expression implementations, is that Raku regexes are **code** under the hood that you specify with Raku's regex syntax.  You can think of a regex as a piece of code that you can call inside another regex, like a subroutine or a method.  This has all sorts of implications, but that will be for another series of blog posts.


Regexes are recognized as a pattern if they start *and* end with a slash (`/`).  Some examples:
```
# Look for the string "foo"
$ rak '/ foo /'

# Look for the string "bar" at the start of a line
$ rak '/^ bar /'

# Look for the string "baz" at the end of a line
$ rak '/ baz $/'

# Look for lines consisting of "Example:" or "Examples:"
$ rak '/^ Example s? ":" $/'

# Look for lines with either "foo" or "bar"
$ rak '/ foo | bar /'

# Look for lines with words that start with "spec"
$ rak '/ << spec \w* /'

Whitespace between the slashes will be ignored.  Any non-alphanumeric character needs to be quoted.

Some tips for a quick understanding of Raku regexes

## Code

## Literal string

## Performance tweak

If you're searching large files, e.g. log files, and you are sure that the files are encoded using Latin-1, you can specify C<--encoding=latin1> as a parameter.  This typically makes searching about 2x as fast, as Raku then doesn't need to interpret the contents into Normalization Form Grapheme (NFG).  This also makes comparisons to similar programs more fair, as none of the other programs support NFG.
