# It's time to rak! (Part 3)

This is a follow-up on [It's time to rak (Part 2)](https://dev.to/lizmat/its-time-to-rak-part-2-18ha).  Well, actually it builds more on [Part 1](https://dev.to/lizmat/its-time-to-rak-part-1-30ji), as Part 2 is a bit of a side-step.  This blog post builds on both though, so it's probably wise to read them both if you haven't already.

## Theory of operation

### Initial collection of files to examine
