On Raku
=======

Please note that all opinions stated in this article are mine, and mine alone.
No consensus of any kind with any group is intended or implied.  All resulting
comments and related outbursts of opinion, should be directed at me.

Very recently, I was asked to
[clarify my stance](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9m2k6l/a_request_to_larry_wall_to_create_a_language_name/e7cdgih/)
on the Perl 6 naming debate.  In short: I don't think there should be another
name for Perl 6, other than perhaps a nickname that would indicate the
implementation.  So "Rakudo Perl 6" or just "Rakudo".  This has been in use
for many years already, and most definitely since Christmas 2015 when the first
official release of Perl 6 was presented to the world.

Perl 6 is the successor of Perl 5.  Just like Perl 5 was the successor of
Perl 4.  That is the way it was intended originally, and that is the way that
it should go in the future.  Anything else would do a disservice to all people
involved in the Perl community.

Because the implementation of Perl 6 has taken much longer than anticipated,
Perl 5 has suffered a lot from
[cannibalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalization_(marketing)).
Which in turn caused a braindrain to other languages, because Perl 5 was
perceived to be dead because of the coming of Perl 6.  This can not be denied.
What also can not be denied, that a lot of Perl 5 code written during the
dot-com boom, was not written by the best of programmers: having been
responsible for clearing out the final bits of original code written by the
founder of a startup that is now a multi-billion dollar company providing jobs
for 20K+ people, I think I know what that was like.  So I think I can say
the demise of Perl 5, was **not** caused by Perl 6.

Some people
[actually argue](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perl6/permalink/2219121021687578/)
that Perl 6 was the result of an attempt to *stop* the already started demise
of Perl 5:

> As I said ... (at) the meeting years ago where P6 was born, which was
> initially a meeting to discuss how to unify the community which was
> fragmenting, nothing good will come of this unless the underlying
> dysfunction of the community is addressed...

Regardless of other reasons for the demise of Perl 5 in the world, Perl 6 has
become the scapegoat as the sole reason for the problems of Perl 5 by many
members of the Perl community.

Renaming requests from Perl 5 users
-----------------------------------
The fact that Perl 5 will always have a version number with a **5** in it,
is seen by many as the source of the problem of not having any future for
Perl 5.  Hence, many have asked for Perl 6 to be renamed.  And perhaps that
would have been a good thing at one point in time: but since its first official
release in December 2015, that ship has sailed for good.  There are now many
Perl 6 books out in the world, 2 published by O'Reilly.  Renaming the current
Perl 6 to something else, and then claiming version numbers with **6** in them
for the current Perl 5 code base, is just going to add to the massive
confusion that already exists.  So that will never happen.

Renaming requests from Perl 6 users
-----------------------------------
Perl 6 users have asked for Perl 6 to be renamed, because the association
with Perl / Perl 5 is very strong.  And currently has a very negative
connotation.  This association could have been prevented had Perl 6 been given
another name in the past.  But again, that ship has sailed when the first
official release of Perl 6 was presented to the world in December 2015.
From my point of view, the strong association can be made into a positive
asset given anough time and effort.  And I still believe in that.

Badgering
---------
But people have continued badgering Larry Wall for another name.  One of them
very public at the
[Perl Conference in Amsterdam](https://youtu.be/E5t8qaAGw9w?t=4886):

> The whole naming thing we've gone over so many times.  I do think that
> we could have other terms by which Perl or Perl distributions are marketed.
> They don't have to be marketed necessarily as Perl, especially in markets
> where that's a swear word... But my interest and feeling is that Perl is
> my thing and whether Perl 5 or Perl 6 that's really the name of the whole
> culture.  And that's why we're all here together.

Recently
[another campaign](https://perl6.party/post/A-Request-to-Larry-Wall-to-Create-a-Language-Name-Alias-for-Perl-6)
was started to give Perl 6 an "extra name".  It stated:

> As such, we are creating an alias only. One that does not have any reference
> to Perl in it (i.e. no "Perl++"). If another name is truly as superior as
> the full-rename proponents claim it would be, I believe the alias can become
> a defacto name through its sheer amount of use. Thus, the creation of the
> alias can be seen as a means for the full-rename proponents to prove their
> claims.

Larry Wall
[had some ideas about that](https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-25#l468)
as a stage name:

> It's the stage name (but Perl 6 still cashes the checks)".

And very recently Larry Wall finally,
[very casually without much formality](https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-11-03#l276)
said that if people wanted to have an "extra name", it should be "raku".

A step back
-----------
Before I go on, I would like to elaborate on the definition of "stage name"
[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name):

> A performer will often take a stage name because his/her real name is
> considered unattractive...

In the early 60s, having a German name in the United States was considered
an impediment to success in the music business.  So a guy called Robert
Allen Zimmerman decides to
[change his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan#Origins_and_musical_beginnings):

> You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens.
> You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the
> free.

So he called himself [`Bob Dylan`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)
and became a world famous artist performing to crowds of many thousands to
this very day.

What do you think would have happened if he had changed his name to:
`Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman`?  Would he have been as successful?  Probably not,
as the negative connotation of "Zimmerman" would still have applied.

Or for the younger ones among us: would `Farrokh Bulsara` have been successful
as `Farrokh "Mercury" Bulsara` instead of
[`Freddie Mercury`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury)?  Or
`Stefani Germanotta` have been successful as `Stefani "Gaga" Germanotta`
instead of [Lady Gaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga)?

Things wrong with the use of "raku"
-----------------------------------
Ever since Larry Wall mentioned that "raku" would have his blessing as a
**stage name**, the name "raku" has been used **in conjunction** with Perl 6.
`"Raku" Perl 6`.  So, `Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman`.

This is **not** the use of "Raku" as a stage name.  It is even in direct
conflict with what was proposed in the last campaign.

In my opinion, it is effectively an
[attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9tws89/its_raku/e90y64u/)
at [rebranding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebranding) "Perl 6" to the
name "Raku".  Thereby being completely passing by the "Perl community"
component that Larry Wall mentioned at the Perl Conference in Amsterdam.

There has been close to **no** communication as to **how** the use of the
alias "Raku" would be implemented within the Perl 6 core development team.
Instead, the originator of the final campaign to get a marketing alias,
took it upon himself to **inject** the word "Raku" in all publications about
Perl 6.  Without consultation with anybody in the Perl 6 core team.  This
has, for all practical purposes, all the qualities of a `coup d'etat` with
regards to the marketing of Perl 6.

If "Raku" is a better name for Perl 6, then it should be able to stand on its
own.  Therefore, any mention of "Raku" in conjunction with "Perl 6" is the
worst of both worlds:

- it spoils the value of "Raku", as it is **still** directly associated with
  Perl.

- it leads users of Perl 5 into thinking that the problems with Perl 5 are over

To repeat: "Raku Perl 6" is the worst possible combination.  It is **not**
a stage name in any shape or form.  It is an attempt at rebranding with the
ultimate goal of eradicating Perl 6 as a name.  And thereby explicitly
dividing the Perl community.  Which doesn't need a lot more dividing anymore
before it completely disappears into oblivion.

Where do we go from here
------------------------
In order for "Raku" (on its own) to get a fair chance at gaining mindshare in
the world, it needs to be separated **as much as possible** from Perl 6,
**specifically** in marketing, and probably in documentation.

I therefore propose to remove all mention of "Raku" from **all** materials
in the [Perl 6 Marketing Repository](https://marketing.perl6.org).  Any
promotional materials for "Raku" should be in a separate repository / site.

All mention of "Raku" in the documentation should also be removed.  Instead,
an automatic translator should be made that will convert all Perl 6
documentation to mention "raku" instead of "Perl 6".  Since Perl is good at
mangling texts, this should not have to be a big effort.

A separate **distribution** should be made from the Rakudo Compiler and
Rakudo Star distributions, where all mention of "perl" is replaced by "raku".
Anything less than that would harm the chances of "Raku" becoming a success.

Several sites on the internet, most notably StackOverflow, allow users of
languages to ask questions about problems they have with a language.  People
asking questions about "raku" should get an answer in "raku", not in Perl 6.
Perhaps a similar question previously answered for Perl 6, might be referenced,
but ideally a new answer should be written.

That is how **I** think "Raku" should be used as a stage name.  People willing
to market Perl 6 as "Raku" would not have to be involved in the development
of Perl 6 at all.  It is, after all, just a marketing name, a stage name.

Winding down
------------
This week I have not written a Perl 6 Weekly because I was too upset about
how a simple line in IRC can wreak so much havoc.  I have felt betrayed by
Larry Wall for caving in to the continuous badgering.  I have been mad at
Larry Wall for not being clearer on how such a "stage name" should be used.
I have been mad at Zoffix Znet, for being offered a finger and taking the
whole hand.  And I have been mad at a p5p member for comparing Perl 6 members
to slave masters.

For me, writing this blog post has been therapeutic.  I feel that I can go
on with making Perl 6 better in every way (too bad that 1.5x faster
improvement on hyper operators didn't make it to the core yet because of
this).

I hope that it can be therapeutic for other people as well.  One can hope.
