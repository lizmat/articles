### Winding down

This week's picture was taken just after sunset today!  It was a very cold bicycle ride, but the views were magnificent.  And such beautiful views should remind us that Ukraine is still fighting the Russian aggression.  Слава Україні!  Героям слава!

Please keep staying safe, keep staying healthy, and keep up the good work!
