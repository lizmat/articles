# Future-proofing the Raku Programming Language

Around this time of year, *Jonathan Worthington* was writing their Advent Post called [Reminiscence, refinement, revolution](https://raku-advent.blog/2020/12/25/day-25-reminiscence-refinement-revolution/).  Today, yours truly finds themselves writing a similar blog post after what can only be called a peculiar year in the world.

## Visible highlights

The Raku Programming Language, as a language, has not seen lot of development this year, as most of the work has been "under the hood".  The most visible highlights in the Raku Programming Language are basically:

### last / next with value

````raku
use v6.e.PREVIEW;
say (^5).grep: { $_ == 3 ?? last False !! True } # (0 1 2)
say (^5).grep: { $_ == 3 ?? last True  !! True } # (0 1 2 3)
````
Normally, `last` just stops an iteration, but now you can give it a value as well, which can be handy e.g. in a `grep` where you know the current value is the last, but you still want to include it.
````raku
use v6.*;
say (^5).map: { next    if $_ == 2; $_ } # (0 1 3 4)
say (^5).map: { next 42 if $_ == 2; $_ } # (0 1 42 3 4)
```
Similarly with `map`, if you want to skip a value (which was already possible), you can now replace that value by another value.

Note that you need to activate the upcoming `6.e` Raku language level to enable this feature, as there were some potential issues when activated in `6.d`.  But that's just one example of future proofing the Raku Programming Language.

### .pick(\*\*)

The `.pick(*)` call will produce all possible values of the `Iterable` on which it is called in random order, and then stop.  The `.pick(**)` will do the same, but then start again producing values in (another) random order until exhausted, ad infinitum.
````raku
.say for (^5).pick(* ); # 3␤4␤0␤2␤1␤
.say for (^5).pick(**); # 3␤4␤0␤2␤1␤0␤2␤1␤4␤3␤3␤4␤2␤1␤0␤....
````

### is implementation-detail trait

The `is implementation-detail` trait indicates that something that *is* publicly visible, still should be considered off-limits as it is a detail of the implementation of something (whether that is your own code, or the core).  This will also mark that something as invisible for standard introspection:
````raku
class A {
    method foo() is implementation-detail { }
    method bar() { }
}
.name.say for A.^methods; # bar␤BUILDALL␤
````
Subroutines and methods in the core that are considered to be an implementation-detail, have been marked as such.  This should make it more clear which parts of the Rakudo implementation are game, and which parts are off-limits for developers (knowing that they can be changed without notice).
