## Drifting Apart

The Raku Programming Language was originally started as the next version of the Perl Programming Language (then at version 5.6.0).  Unfortunately the implementation of this next version took *much* longer than expected.  In the eyes of many Perl users the new version also changed the character of the language, which caused a rift in the Perl community.

When in late 2015 the initial release of what was then called "Perl6" came out, the rift only deepened: not wanting to relinquish the "Perl" nomer was felt by many in the Perl community as name squatting.  In late 2019 the name squatting issue was resolved by changing the name of "Perl6" to the "Raku Programming Language".

# Project Representation

Open source projects that exist beyond the scope of the original developer need to have a way to be represented, and usually also a way to finance vital project infrastructure: technical infrastructure (such as providing websites and testing services), as well as organisational infrastructure (such as regular user events, Code of Conduct online and at events, project course decisions) and developmental support (such as grants).

Because of Raku's historical roots, this has been taken care of (or sponsored by) Yet Another Society (or YAS, to most better known as "TPF" or "The Perl Foundation").  After the name change of the language, YAS acquired a new alias: The Perl and Raku Foundation (or short: TPRF).  But it has always felt like a remnant of historical connection that Raku had with Perl, rather than something that was a natural result of the developing situation.

Keeping an Open Source foundation running requires volunteers willing to spend a sizeable amount of their free time on foundation matters.  And it requires a source of funds to keep the foundation in working order.

# Towards a Raku Foundation

Historically YAS has received funding from many sources.  Initially to support just Perl, later this was separated into support for Perl 5 and what was to be Perl 6.  Over the years it has become more difficult for YAS to obtain funding.  And has not received much funding for what is now Raku: there are probably many reasons for that, one of them being that Raku as a separate target for funding is not very visible on the foundation's website.

Now, more than five years after the name change, it feels like a good time for the Raku community to be standing on its own feet, without YAS.  Therefore I hereby announce the intent to set up a completely separate Raku Foundation, based in Europe but global in reach.

This would allow YAS to be fully focussing on the one programming language that instigated the creation of the foundation: Perl.  And it would allow the Raku Community to be served by a foundation that is solely dedicated to the Raku Programming Language.

## Initial Funding

Founding a non-profit foundation that is supported by donations, is a bit of a chicken / egg situation: one needs to pay some instances (such as a notary public, and possibly some other regulatory instances).  I volunteer to be advancing these costs to make this process easier.  As soon as the foundation is set up, a bank account can be opened, and a website can be set up with a donate button linked to the foundation's bank account.

## Bylaws and Regulations

A foundation needs to have bylaws, which need to be approved by a notary public.  The regulations of a foundation can be changed by the board, provided they are not in conflict with the bylaws.  It is therefore customary to keep the bylaws simple and general.  And have the board adjust the regulations as necessary.  Taking this approach would make it possible to use the defunct, but still legally existing YAPC Europe Foundation to take a "doing business as" name "Raku Foundation".  Provided the current board would agree to this, and this was felt as a good solution by the Raku Community, of course!

## Finding Board members

A foundation needs board members.  A small number of them need to be registered as the legal board: others may be appointed by the board without needing formal registration.  Who could be a board member?  I'm thinking of people who in the past have been (deeply) involved in the development of what is now Raku, but who have drifted away from active development.  But still have a place for Raku in their heart.  Please let me know if any of this applies to you, and you want to become a board member!

## Legal Challenges

The copyright of the Raku Programming Language currently lies with YAS.  Whether or not this copyright should be passed on to a Raku Foundation, is something that should be figured out whether that is a. possible, and b. a good thing to do.

## Upcoming Challenges

One of the big challenges coming up for Open Source communities, is the upcoming enforcement of the [Cyber Resilience Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act) in 2027.  I believe a strong Raku Foundation will be able to take advantage of the opportunities this act brings to Open Source communities by being an Open Source Steward for the Raku Community.

## Actually Starting

To gather comments and suggestions, I have opened a [problem solving issue](https://github.com/raku/problem-solving/issues/new) in which hopefully many will let their opinions know.  If you don't have a Github account, please send an email to foundation@raku.org: I will then include your comments / opinions on the issue.
