# The second second

> This is a second follow-up on [Raku Resolutions](https://dev.to/lizmat/series/34948) series.

The second meeting was held on 7 February 2026 at 19:00 UTC.  Apart from 4 Raku Steering Council members, up to 5 other people attended with a true worldwide spread: local times spanning from UTC-8 to UTC+11!  Thank you all for your attendance and your feedback!

In the end, **2** issues were discussed within the allotted time (1 hour).  Both had extensive discussions, but no immediate resoluton.

## [Raku Classification System](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/489)

This discussion took most of the time, as it is indeed could be a very big project.  It was felt that this was a project worth pursuing, and that having more meta-data on Raku and its uses would be very valuable.  *Tim Nelson* [replied after the meeting](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/489#issuecomment-3865236200).  To be continued (but probably through the issue, and not merely at these meetings).

## [Function return types should also tell about the used assignment/container](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/337)

It became clear that this is not just a documentation issue, but in a way a language design (and implementation) issue as well.  The argument was made that when some functionality is made that returns a mutable entity, it should be clearly visible (for instance [`substr`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Str#routine_substr) versus [`substr-rw`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Str#method_substr-rw)).  *Martin Polgar* summarized [the result](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/337#issuecomment-3867569693).

## The next meeting

The next meeting will be held at 21 February 2026 at 19:00 UTC (20:00 CET, 14:00 EST, 11:00 PST, 04:00 JST (22 Jan), 06:00 AEST (22 Jan)), and again at a one hour maximum.  If not all of these issues have been resolved, they will be moved to a future meeting.

Since Jitsi is still working out so far, the next one will be held at the same URL: [https://meet.jit.si/SpecificRosesEstablishAllegedly](https://meet.jit.si/SpecificRosesEstablishAllegedly).  The reason Jitsi was selected, is that it has proven to be working with minimal hassle for at least the Raku Steering Council meetings.  As the only thing you need to be able to attend, is a modern browser, a camera, and a microphone.  No further installation required.

The remaining issues that will be discussed, are:

- [Function return types should also tell about the used assignment/container](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/337)
- [Raku Classification System](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/489)

and any other issues that people want to discuss.

## Preparation

Any Raku Community member is welcome to this meeting.  Do you consider yourself a Raku Community member?  You're welcome.  It's as simple as that.

But please make sure you have looked at the issues that will be discussed **before** attending the meeting.  And if you already have any comments to make on these issues, make them with the issue beforehand.

The original contributors to these issues will also be notified (unless they muted themselves from these issues).  We hope that they also will be able to attend.

## Small steps

If you consider yourself a Raku Community member, please try to attend!  If anything, it will allow you to put faces to the names that you may be familiar with.

Hope to see you there!
